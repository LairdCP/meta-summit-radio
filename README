I. Adding the laird-cp layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the laird-cp layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the laird-cp layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-laird-cp \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer supports the following modules:
    - Sterling & Summit 60, Sterling LWB/LWB5/LWB5+ Wi-Fi & BT drivers and firmware
    - Sterling & Summit WPA supplicant
    - Laird NetworkManager

 - To use the Wi-Fi and BT driver add the backports and firmware package corresponding to the
   desired module to your image recipe.  Ensure the kernel config does not include Wi-Fi and
   Bluetooth components that are provided via backports.
   To make these changes perform a kernel menuconfig and/or change the kernel defconfig
   then completely rebuild the kernel:
     bitbake -c clean virtual/kernel
     bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
       1. Remove cfg80211, mac80211, bluetooth from the kernel config
       2. Explicitly add the cfg80211, mac80211, and bluetooth  dependencies (mostly crypto)
          to the kernel config
     bitbake <image name>

 - To use Laird Network Manager add the "laird-networkmanager" package to your image recipe

 - Summit firmware and userspace packages are not provided on the public Github.  They must
   be manually downloaded and placed into <yocto top dir>/release folder if needed.

 - To use the Laird Connectivity Sterling or Summit supplicant:
    - add the  "<sterling|summit>-supplicant" package to your image recipe
    - add the following to your local.conf or <distro>.conf:
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "<sterling|summit>-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "<sterling|summit>-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "<sterling|summit>-supplicant"

 - This layer provides a set of example image recipes that can be used as references

Additional requirements for Yocto release 'zeus' (3.0) and later:

 - wireless-regdb-static provider must be specified in local.conf or <distro>.conf
   When using 60 Series firmware packages, the wireless-regdb-static provider must be set
   to the firmware package added to the image and used for the radio:
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "<firmware package>"

   When using LWB/LWB5/LWB5+ firmware packages, the wireless-regdb-static provider must 
   be set to the upstream provider:
		PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "wireless-regdb"

 - OpenSSL 1.0.x related recipes must be disabled:
   Adding the following text into local.conf or <disto>.conf:
        BBMASK += " \
            meta-laird-cp/recipes-packages/openssl \
            meta-laird-cp/recipes-packages/.*/.*openssl10.* \
        "
LWB, LWB5, LWB5+ driver common issues:
  - The regulatory domain must be specified in the platform based on the destination of the
    target device.  Failure to do this will prevent the Wi-Fi driver from loading.  See the
	Software Integration Guide for more details.

  - 130 ms delay on loading the firmware
    Remove CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK from kernel config

  - STMicro unaligned scatterlist error
    Add  entry to the device tree for brcm driver:
      brcm,sd_sgentry_align = /bits/ 16 <32>;
