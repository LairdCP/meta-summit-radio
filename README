This provides 2 variants of the meta-summit-radio layer:

meta-summit-radio - for Yocto 3.4 (Honister) and later
meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4 - for any Yocto release prior to 3.4

The distinction is needed because bb file syntax changed incompatibly in Yocto 3.4

Please use appropriate layer variant for your system. DO NOT include both layers.

For detailed integration instructions and common issues please read README file inside 
the appropriate layer
